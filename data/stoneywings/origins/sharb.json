    "description": "An overshadowed race of avians, this origin hides in the shadows in order to hunt its prey. By day, you are a blind prey that struggles to survive due to being sensitive to sunlight, but at night, you are a feared predator that looms over those unlucky enough to have mocked and crossed paths with you."
